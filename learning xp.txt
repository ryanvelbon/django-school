3. populate.py script with functions which can be invoked separately from CLI
     PROBLEM
     - We would like to invoke the function bar() from our foo.py script

     SOLUTION
     - Do not run the module as a main program
     - i.e., do not write...    if __name__ == "__main__"
     - Instead, open a Python shell in CLI, import the module and invoke the required function, like so:
     - $ python
     - $ >>> import foo
     - $ >>> foo.bar()


4. Customising UserCreationForm
     - By default, UserCreationForm only asks for username, password, and password confirmation.
     - We wish to ask for other details.

5. Automatically generating a username when a user creates an account

7. When creating a Model object with a FK field; the FK field must be passed a primary key.
     - See users/tests.py test_valid_date() function.
     - Otherwise you will get the following error: "Select a valid choice. That choice is not one of the available choices."
