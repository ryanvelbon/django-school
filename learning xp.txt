     - Backend validation
     - Frontend validation

3. populate.py script with functions which can be invoked separately from CLI
     PROBLEM
     - We would like to invoke the function bar() from our foo.py script

     SOLUTION
     - Do not run the module as a main program
     - i.e., do not write...    if __name__ == "__main__"
     - Instead, open a Python shell in CLI, import the module and invoke the required function, like so:
     - $ python
     - $ >>> import foo
     - $ >>> foo.bar()
